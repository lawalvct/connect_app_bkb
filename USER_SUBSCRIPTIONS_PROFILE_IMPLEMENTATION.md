# Active Subscriptions Added to User Profile

## âœ… **Implementation Complete**

I've successfully added active subscriptions to the user profile resource response.

## ðŸ”§ **Changes Made**

### 1. **UserController.php Updates**

-   Added `UserSubscriptionHelper` import
-   Modified `show()` method to fetch active subscriptions using `UserSubscriptionHelper::getActiveSubscriptionsWithDetails()`
-   Added `$user->active_subscriptions = $activeSubscriptions;` to the computed fields

### 2. **UserResource.php Updates**

-   Added comprehensive `active_subscriptions` field to the resource array
-   Included subscription details with proper timezone conversion
-   Added calculated fields like `days_remaining`

## ðŸ“Š **Subscription Data Structure**

The user profile now includes an `active_subscriptions` array with the following information for each subscription:

```json
{
    "active_subscriptions": [
        {
            "id": 123,
            "subscription_id": 1,
            "subscription_name": "Connect Premium",
            "slug": "connect-premium",
            "description": "Premium subscription with unlimited features",
            "amount": 29.99,
            "currency": "USD",
            "payment_method": "stripe",
            "payment_status": "completed",
            "status": "active",
            "features": [
                "unlimited_swipes",
                "premium_filters",
                "priority_support"
            ],
            "started_at": "2025-09-01T10:00:00Z",
            "expires_at": "2025-10-01T10:00:00Z",
            "auto_renew": true,
            "days_remaining": 27
        }
    ]
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features**

-   âœ… **Only Active Subscriptions**: Only shows currently active and non-expired subscriptions
-   âœ… **Complete Details**: Includes subscription name, features, pricing, and status
-   âœ… **Timezone Conversion**: All dates converted to user's timezone

## ðŸ“± **Usage**

When calling the user profile endpoint:

```http
GET /api/v1/user
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

The response will now include the `active_subscriptions` array with all active subscription details.
