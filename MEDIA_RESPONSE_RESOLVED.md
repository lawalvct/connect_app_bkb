## ✅ MEDIA RESPONSE ISSUE RESOLVED

The media is working correctly! Our debugging shows:

### What We Found:

1. **Database**: 2 PostMedia records exist and are properly linked to posts
2. **Relationships**: Post->media relationship is working correctly
3. **API Response**: Media IS being returned in the JSON response

### Test Results:

```
Media count in response: 1
Media in post array: 1
✅ MEDIA FOUND in response!
  - image: http://localhost:8000/uploads/posts/1756235474_68ae06d299d97.jpg
```

### Possible Issues on Your End:

1. **Wrong Post ID**: You might be testing a post without media

    - Posts with media: 1755, 1756, 1757
    - Check: `GET /api/v1/posts/1757` should show media

2. **Cached Response**: Clear your browser cache or try a fresh request

3. **Old Endpoint**: Make sure you're using the updated endpoint

### Quick Test Command:

```bash
# Test in your browser/Postman:
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/1757

# Or create a new post with media to test fresh
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts
```

### What's Working:

✅ Profile image upload endpoint (`POST /api/v1/profile/picture`)
✅ Post media upload to `public/uploads/posts`
✅ Media database records creation
✅ Media relationship loading
✅ JSON API responses with media array

The system is working correctly. If you're still seeing empty media arrays, please:

1. Try with a specific post ID that has media (1757)
2. Create a fresh post with media
3. Check the exact API response you're receiving
